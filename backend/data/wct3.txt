About WalletConnect Token
What is WalletConnect and the WalletConnect Token (WCT)?
The WalletConnect Network is the onchain UX ecosystem powering 150 million connections for over 23 million users across 600 wallets, 40K app projects, and all chains. It is the open and decentralized network that enables users to connect to apps onchain, designed for both utility and ownership without compromises. The WalletConnect Token (WCT) is integral to the WalletConnect Network — fueling the onchain UX ecosystem by empowering its community of users, apps, and wallets to contribute to a better onchain future through shared incentives. Launching on Optimism’s OP Mainnet, the token will employ Ethereum’s security and OP Mainnet’s speed.
How many WCT coins are there in circulation?
The initial supply of WCT tokens is capped at 1 billion, with allocations designed to support the Network's growth and sustainability.
In the initial design of the WalletConnect Network's tokenomics, token inflation is not contemplated as a mechanism for token distribution or network sustainability. The current model focuses on utilizing existing token allocations and fee structures to support network operations and incentivize participation. However, the network's governance structure and community retain the flexibility to implement inflation mechanisms in the future if deemed necessary.
