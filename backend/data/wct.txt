Please Note:
Users need to upgrade the Binance App version to 2.89.0 and above.

Snapshots of user balances and total pool balances will be taken multiple times at any point of time each hour to get users’ hourly average balances and calculate user rewards. User rewards will be updated each hour. 

Users will be able to accumulate their rewards (calculated each hour) and claim these rewards directly to their Spot Accounts at any time.

Each pool’s annual percentage yield (APY) and total pool balance will be updated in real time.

Tokens can only be locked in one pool at a time. For example, User A cannot lock the same BNB into two different pools at the same time, but can allocate 50% of their BNB into pool A and 50% into pool B.

Users will be able to unlock their funds at any time with no delay and participate in any other available Launchpools immediately.

Tokens locked in each Launchpool and any unclaimed rewards will be automatically transferred to each user’s Spot Accounts at the end of each farming period.

Users who have locked their BNB in Flexible Products and Locked Products, including Binance BNB Simple Earn and On-chain Yields Products, will automatically participate in the Launchpool and receive new token rewards.

If there is more than one Launchpool project running concurrently, users' BNB assets in BNB Flexible Products and Locked Products will be split and allocated into each project equally, unless otherwise specified.

BNB Flexible Products assets used as collateral for Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) are not entitled to Launchpool rewards.

Staked Lista BNB (slisBNB) and Lista collateral BNB (clisBNB) in Binance Keyless Wallet will be supported in Launchpool reward calculation.

Spot Algo Orders will also be enabled for the aforementioned pairs at 2025-04-15 11:00 (UTC), while Trading Bots & Spot Copy Trading will be enabled within 24 hours of it being listed on Spot. For users with running Spot Copy Trading portfolios, pairs can be included by enabling them in the [Personal Pair Preference] section of the Spot Copy Trading settings.

BNB locked into Launchpool will still provide users with the standard benefits for holding BNB, such as airdrops and VIP benefits.

Binance reserves the right to disqualify and revoke rewards for participants who engage in dishonest or abusive activities during the Launchpool, including but not limited to registering from the same IP or device, bulk-account registrations to farm additional bonuses and any other activity in connection with unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful purposes.

Participation in Launchpool is subject to eligibility based on the user's country or region of residence. Please refer to the instructions on the Launchpool page.

Please note that the list of excluded countries provided below is not exhaustive and may be subject to changes due to evolving local rules, regulations, or other considerations. Currently, users from the following countries or regions will not be able to participate in farming WCT: Australia, Canada, Cuba, Crimea Region, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, Netherlands, North Korea, Syria, United States of America and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands), and any non-government controlled areas of Ukraine
