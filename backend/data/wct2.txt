@WalletConnect  (WCT): The Token You’ll Wish You Didn’t Miss

Imagine being early to a project that’s already powering millions of crypto users every single day — but most people still don’t realize it.

◽️That’s WalletConnect.

And now, they’re finally launching their own token — WCT — and guess what?

You can farm it for FREE. Right now. On Binance Launchpool.

No cost. No risk. No “what ifs.”

If you’re in crypto, this is one of those rare moments you don’t want to sleep on.

➺ Why WalletConnect Matters (More Than You Think)

Let’s be real: the biggest headache in Web3 isn’t the tech — it’s the user experience.

Confusing logins. Sketchy pop-ups. Endless wallets that don’t “just work.”

WalletConnect has been quietly solving that problem since 2018 — connecting wallets and apps seamlessly across any blockchain, any device, anytime.

You’ve probably used it without even realizing it.

Now, they’re evolving into something bigger — the WalletConnect Network, a decentralized powerhouse run by contributors, nodes, and YOU.

The heart of it all? WCT, their new governance and utility token.

➺ The WCT Token: More Than Just a Coin

This isn’t just another token for hype.

WCT is designed to reward early adopters, empower users, and build the future of onchain UX.

◽️Here’s how it works:

1. Power of the People (Governance)

You're not just holding a coin — you’re shaping the future. Vote on network upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem decisions.

2. Real Rewards

17.5% of the entire token supply is set aside for YOU. The early believers.

5% drops in the first year alone — free tokens, just for supporting the network.

3. High-Stakes Staking

Stake your WCT to help secure the network — and earn more in return.

Longer commitment = higher rewards. It’s that simple.

4. Future Utility That Actually Matters

Pay network fees

Unlock beta testing programs

Get early access to apps

Influence seasonal wallet picks

Stake to get into the Certified App program

This is long-term thinking, not just another pump-and-dump.

➺ Already Changing Web3 (and Getting Ready to Scale)

WalletConnect already connects the biggest apps and wallets in crypto.

◽️Chain-agnostic

◽️High uptime

◽️Lightning fast

◽️Fully decentralized

Today it’s free for apps. But soon, they’ll pay fees in WCT — and those fees?

They’ll be shared back with wallet partners, node operators, and contributors.

It’s a full-circle economy, built on fairness.

➺ Tokenomics Snapshot (Simple + Sustainable)

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 WCT

Initial Circulating: 186,200,000 WCT (18.6%)

Listing Date on Binance Spot: April 15, 2025 @ 11:00 UTC

➺ Distribution:

Rewards: 17.5%

Airdrops: 18.5%

Early Backers: 11.5%

➺ Token Release Strategy

No inflation planned in the first 3-4 years.

Token usage and reward systems are prioritized over printing new tokens.

Governance has the flexibility to introduce inflation later if needed.



◽️ Backed by Big Players (And Playing the Long Game)

WalletConnect’s token journey has been thoughtful and strategic:

Private rounds with angels and top investors

Bitget sale (20M tokens)

CoinList sale (19.9M tokens)

4-year lockups for major backers (skin in the game!)

This isn’t a rushed project. It’s been carefully built for years — and the token is just the next step.

➺ How YOU Can Get In — Free

This is where it gets exciting.

Right now, you can farm WCT on Binance Launchpool — zero cost.

All you need is a little $BNB , $FDUSD , or $USDC .



◽️ Here’s how:

1. Head to Binance Launchpool

2. Stake BNB, FDUSD, or USDC

3. Earn WCT daily

4. Unstake anytime

No trading, no buying, no stress.

Just free WCT, for being early.



➺ This Might Be One of the Most Underrated Launchpools Yet

We’ve seen it before.

BNB was once a free airdrop.

UNI was once “just a governance token.”

ARB was “just another launch.”

But those who acted early? They didn’t just make gains — they became part of something big.

WalletConnect is already everywhere.

Now it’s time for WCT to take the spotlight.

➺ The Bottom Line?

Don’t wait. Don’t overthink. Just farm.

This is your shot to be early, to earn passively, and to own a piece of a protocol that’s already proven its value.

You’re not just collecting a token. You’re stepping into the future of Web3.
